# Welcome to CDK in C#!

This is a sample project to help you count your Lambda function calls.

The `cdk.json` file tells the CDK Toolkit how to execute your app.

It uses the [.NET Core CLI](https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/articles/core/) to compile and execute your project.

## Useful commands

* `npm install -g aws-cdk` - install aws-cdk
* `cdk init app --language csharp` - create project
* `code .` - run VS Code
* `cdk bootstrap` - bootstrapping an environment
* `dotnet build src` compile this app
* `cdk deploy`       deploy this stack to your default AWS account/region
* `cdk diff`         compare deployed stack with current state
* `cdk synth`        emits the synthesized CloudFormation template
